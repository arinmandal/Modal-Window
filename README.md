# Modal-Window
A modal window creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible, with the modal window as a child window in front of it. Users must interact with the modal window before they can return to the parent application. This avoids interrupting the workflow on the main window.</br>
 Created with DOM & KeyboardEvent.
Through this small project you will see how KeyboardEVents works.
